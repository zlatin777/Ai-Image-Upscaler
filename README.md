**Upscayl is a cross-platform application built with the Linux-first philosophy. This means that we prioritize Linux builds over others but that doesn't mean we'll break things for other OSes :)**

### NOTE: Upscayl does not work without a GPU, sorry. You'll need a Vulkan compatible GPU to upscale images.

# FAQ ü§ì

- How does Upscayl work?
  - Upscayl uses AI models to enhance your images by guessing what the details could be. It uses Real-ESRGAN (and more in the future) model to achieve this.
- Is there a CLI available?
  - The CLI tool is called real-esrgan-ncnn-vulkan and it's available on the Real-ESRGAN repository.
- Do I need a GPU for this to work?
  - Yes, unfortunately. NCNN Vulkan requires a Vulkan compatible GPU. Upscayl won't work on iGPU or CPU.
- How can I contribute?
  - You can donate more NCNN compatible models or fix code by submitting PRs :)

Upscayl uses Real-ESRGAN-ncnn-vulkan binaries to upscale images. More models and algorithms will come soon.
